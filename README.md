# Speech2Text-Transformer
Speech2Text-Transformer is a PyTorch-based Speech-to-Text system built on transformer architectures. It integrates custom dataset handling, byte-pair encoding (BPE) tokenization, and vector quantization (VQ) loss. The project supports the Common Voice / TIMIT dataset and includes an extendable training loop for experimentation.
